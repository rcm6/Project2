## Project Title

React News Aggregator

## Description

A news aggregator web application built entirely with React and sources news from two separate API's: Peregon and Reddit API. This web application also uses Openweather API to get the current weather based on the users location, using the built in Geolocation API.

## Installation

Except for a web browser, this web application does not need any installation.

## Usage

The application is simple and intuitive to use: operates as a normal website and a user can search for news using the search bar, where news based on the users search term will be rendered on the same page. These will be displayed as card items and if clicked on will open another tab leading to the main website where the full news article is hosted.
